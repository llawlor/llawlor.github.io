I recently purchased the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TECHNOLOGY-X-ONE-Printer-Structure-Touchscreen/dp/B01HZ4HY9I">Qidi X-one 3d printer</a>, here are some notes.

<br>

<h3>Sensor error or power is not enough</h3>
When I first tried to print, whenever I tried preheating the base or printing from a file, I would get the error "sensor error or power is not enough".  I eventually figured out that this was due to a loose connection in the cable that connects to the build base.  The white wire was not fully connected, and I just had to push it in a bit more and the error was resolved.

<h3>Tangled spool</h3>
On one of my earlier prints, I checked on the printer to find that none of the PLA material was coming out of the nozzle.  The spool had become tangled in the back because I had not fully clipped the white guide tube in place.  Once I fully clipped the guide tube in place this problem was resolved.

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
Printing with the Qidi X-one has been very easy, and the prints have come out great.  I've used both PLA and ABS to print objects, and am overall very happy with the results.
